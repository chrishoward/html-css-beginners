## Udemy Course: HTML and CSS for Beginners
:hammer_and_wrench:  Programming Languages: `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `PHP`

:book:  Course information: https://www.udemy.com/html-and-css-for-beginners-crash-course-learn-fast-easy/  

Lessons consisted of videos of code being typed and the associated theory explained. I reproduced the code in my own HTML files and experimented with the code during each lesson. Also included were multiple choice quizzes and coding exercises. Not all of the working files from the course have been uploaded to GitHub as some of them were too short and basic.
